## Answers

### Oppression by corporations is more of a concern than oppression by governments.

Unsure.

Corporations can be evil, but they hardly deal physical harm.

### It is necessary for the government to intervene in the economy to protect consumers.

Strongly agree.

Externalities and oligopolies are real things, and no "invisible hand" takes care of that.

### The freer the markets, the freer the people.

Agree.

The question is not phrased that well, so not "Strongly agree". But certainly more than just "Neutral".

### It is better to maintain a balanced budget than to ensure welfare for all citizens.

Unsure.

Both "balanced budget" and "welfare" are too tricky for me to answer this. I'm against welfare beyond some bare minimum ("food, shelter, medical care, and Internet"), but I'm also against the idea of balacing the budget for the sake of balancing the budget.

### Publicly-funded research is more beneficial to the people than leaving it to the market.

Strongly agree.

Virtually any means to put more money into fundamental sciences and cutting edge engineering has my support. Especially if this money is taken away from openly non-meritocratic institutions such as, well, welfare.

### International trade is beneficial.

Strongly agree.

Isolation never works. It's good to invest into countries' sustainability, but most of the against-international-trade effort nowadays is simply nationalistic to my taste.

### From each according to his ability, to each according to his needs.

Strongly disagree.

Economically and socially, this myth has been debunked. Philosophically, I insist that people should f*cking work and f*cking earn what they've worked for, not be miraculously provided with benefits out of nowhere.

### It would be best if social programs were abolished in favor of private charity.

Strongly agree.

I generally dislike the term "social programs".

### Taxes should be increased on the rich to provide for the poor.

Strongly disagree.

The "tax gap" between the rich and the poor is already large enough. I'm pro flat tax and luxury tax btw. If you and I live the same lifestyles, but I make $1M a year and you make $50K a year, why on Earth should I pay more taxes?

### Inheritance is a legitimate form of wealth.

Unsure.

The statement does sound wrong in many ways, but not enough for me to plain disagree with it.

### Public utilities like roads and electricity should be publicly owned.

Strongly agree.

Natural monopolies are best to be centrally run.

### Excessive government intervention is a threat to the economy.

Strongly agree.

High-level entrepreneurship always borders the boundaries of both what's possible and what's legal. Think Uber and AirBnb. Government should intervent when the customer can possibly lose because of being abused, but no intervention beyond that point is ever necessary.

### Those with a greater ability to pay should receive better healthcare.

Agree.

Not strongly, but certainly agree.

### Quality education is a right of all people.

Strongly agree.

### The means of production should belong to the workers who use them.

Strongly disagree.

What does "should" mean here? Divide and conquer? Revolution? Anarchy?

If whoever owns the means of production a) employs people on the terms people are willing to work, and b) pays the relevant taxes and fees, I think the system is stable and does not require intervention.

### The United Nations should be abolished.

Strongly agree.

I see some value in an organization like the UN, but what it's doing is the absurd theater these days.

### Military action by our nation is often necessary to protect it.

Unsure.

A few years ago I'd say "Strongly disagree". Today I see the secondary and not-too-secondary benefits of justifying military investments to the citizens paying taxes. And there are plenty of areas on our small planet where not just the existence of military force, but also the readiness to use it, is better than plain words.

### I support regional unions, such as the European Union.

Agree.

Not "strongly agree", as I'm generally pro independence, and unions often regulate the shit away, making life harder for small businesses. But a poor friendship is generally better than sustained hatred.

### It is important to maintain our national sovereignty.

Agree.

Any strong contry is better off investing at least a bit into making sure it can stay strong while being independent. One could call it a privilege, but, given it's the case, I agree maintaining sovereignty is worth it.

### A united world government would be beneficial to mankind.

Disagree.

Decentralization wins here. At least to my libertarian view.

### It is more important to retain peaceful relations than to further our strength.

Unsure.

"Stop, or I'll stay stop again" is always worse than "If you do X again I shoot" followed by a shot.

As long as "further our strength" doesn't imply being violent up front, I think it's generally a reliable way to build relationships that are solid first, and friendly afterwards.

### Wars do not need to be justified to other countries.

Disagee.

### Military spending is a waste of money.

Disagree.

### International aid is a waste of money.

Strongly agree.

In its present form, of course.

### My nation is great.

Unsure.

Neither "my nation" nor "great nation" are in my book today. :-)

### Research should be conducted on an international scale.

Strongly agree.

### Governments should be accountable to the international community.

Agree.

Not strongly, because an imaginary "rebel" government that ignores the international community and does the things their own, effective, way would have my utmost sympathy.

### Even when protesting an authoritarian government, violence is not acceptable.

Strongly agree.

### My religious values should be spread as much as possible.

Strongly disagree.

### Our nation's values should be spread as much as possible.

Disagree.

Not strongly, as for any nation that fits for "my" nation its values are "above average". "As much as possible" is an overkill though.

### It is very important to maintain law and order.

Agree.

Not as the ultimate goal (law and order are the means), and not "very", but agree.

### The general populace makes poor decisions.

Strongly agree.

Most people are morons. (c) Linus Torvalds. This is not to mention all those social and psychological experiments proving how bad humans are at making judgment calls, and how easily can they be manipulated.

### Victimless crimes (such as drug use) should not be crimes at all.

Agree.

Not strongly because some victimless crimes do inevitably lead to victims. Like drawing a bunch of swasticas in certain neighborhood. But generally agree, and strongly agree when it comes to drug use.

### The sacrifice of some civil liberties is necessary to protect us from acts of terrorism.

Disagree.

No evidence "sacrifice" is necessary here. Some constaining of civil liberties, sure, but not "sacrifice".

### Government surveillance is necessary in the modern world.

Agree.

Some surveillance will take place inevitably; based on publicly available at least. Better to have a controlling entity here.

### The very existence of the state is a threat to our liberty.

Strongly disagree.

Too anarchy-libertarian to my taste. Almost as silly as "taxation is theft" or "abortion is murder".

### Regardless of political opinions, it is important to side with your country.

Disagree.

Not strongly, as some degree of loyalty should certainly be present in the modern world (otherwise more religious and/or more dogmatic societies will take over). But generally I'm very much pro open critique.

### No authority should be left unquestioned.

Strongly agree.

### A hierarchical state is best.

Disagree.

Peer-to-peer is more flexible and harder to disrupt than vertical.

### It is important that the government follows the majority opinion, even if it is wrong.

Strongly disagree.

Because people are morons who can easily be manipulated.

### The stronger the leadership, the better.

Disagree.

Again, decentralization beats authority in my book.

### Democracy is more than a decision-making process.

Agree.

It's the mindset and culture more than just a set of policies that are traditionally followed.

### Environmental regulations are essential.

Strongly agree.

### A better world will come from automation, science, and technology.

Strongly agree.

### Children should be educated in religious or traditional values.

Strongly disagree.

### Traditions are of no value on their own.

Agree.

Not strongly. But sometimes a force that keeps people together is what helps the state of the art to not fall apart. But tradidions are only valuable when there's community support, and people who openly and actively stand for them.

### Religion should play a role in government.

Strongly disagree.

I'd much prefer the government that's openly rational, and openly ignorant of requests that can not be justified by the means other than "we believe that ...".

### Churches should be taxed the same way other institutions are taxed.

Strongly agree.

In fact, churches should be taxed much higher. Much like carbon tax or other taxes to compensate for negative externalities that are a side effect of some business. The side effects of churches can be devastating. (Note that I do not disagree religions and religious institutions have been veyr helpful at setting up our society to the way it exists today. In certain communities churches would still deal more good than harm. But generally, assuming it's the educated people whose opinion matters when it comes to moving the world forward, I think organized religion is a backwards movement.)

### Climate change is currently one of the greatest threats to our way of life.

Strongly agree.

Note that I'm not at all opening the conversation of whether humans are responsible for it. Even if climate change is a natural occurrence we have nothing to do with. It's still one of the major threats, if not the major threat.

### It is important that we work as a united world to combat climate change.

Strongly agree.

### Society was better many years ago than it is now.

Strongly disagree.

I'm pro progress.

### It is important that we maintain the traditions of our past.

Agree.

Hope in several dozen generations, as we do last this long, it would no longer be necessary. For now, traditions do help to keep us together.

### It is important that we think in the long term, beyond our lifespans.

Strongly agree.

### Reason is more important than maintaining our culture.

Strongly agree.

### Drug use should be legalized or decriminalized.

Strongly agree.

### Same-sex marriage should be legal.

Strongly agree.

### No cultures are superior to others.

Stringly disagree.

There certainly are bad cultures. Like the ones in the questions right above and right below this one :-)

### Sex outside marriage is immoral.

Strongly disagree.

### If we accept migrants at all, it is important that they assimilate into our culture.

Agree.

Not strongly, as migrants should help define what "our culture", or just "culture" is.

### Abortion should be prohibited in most or all cases.

Strongly disagree.

### Gun ownership should be prohibited for those without a valid reason.

Disagree.

### I support single-payer, universal healthcare.

Unsure.

I don't have a formed opinion here.

### Prostitution should be illegal.

Disagree.

I'm against prostitiution. But I'm more against moralists making calls such that "only mentally unstable people would consider doing that". Must be a personal call.

### Maintaining family values is essential.

Agree.

Not strongly, but certainly more agree than neutral.

### To chase progress at all costs is dangerous.

Disagree.

To justify slowing down progress "because it may be too expensive" is even more dangerous.

### Genetic modification is a force for good, even on humans.

Strongly agree.

### We should open our borders to immigration.

Agree.

I'm pro meritocracy. If someone can be a better employee and a better member of the society, who cares where have they been born?

### Governments should be as concerned about foreign citizens as they are about those within their borders.

Agree.

In a sense that "equal in front of the law", most certainly. In a sense of "no discrimination", most certainly.

In a sense that "let's check one's immigration status if uncertain" -- I'd agree too :-)

### All people - regardless of factors like culture or sexuality - should be treated equally.

Strongly agree.

### It is important that we further my group's goals above all others.

Disagree.

Plurality of opinions is a great thing to have. Obviously, to me my group's goals are the best ones. But only through them being challenged fairly we can move forward.
